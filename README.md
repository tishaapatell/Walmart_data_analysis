# Walmart_data_analysis
Walmart Sales & Profitability Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Walmart’s sales dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and profitability insights across different product categories, locations, and customer behaviors. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations that can support decision-making in inventory management, pricing strategy, and marketing campaigns.
 
⚙️ Environment Setup
1. Tools Used
•	Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Development environment
•	Python 3.8+ – Data analysis and processing
•	SQL Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL – For structured data storage and SQL analysis
Goal: Create a structured workspace in VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.
 
2. Set Up Kaggle API
•	Obtain API Key: Download your kaggle.json file from Kaggle API settings under your profile.
•	Configure: Place kaggle.json in your local .kaggle/ folder.
•	Download Dataset:
kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>
•	Storage: Save datasets in the data/ folder for easy reference.
 
3. Download Walmart Sales Data
•	Data Source: Kaggle – Walmart Sales Dataset
•	Save files to data/ directory.
 
4. Install Required Libraries
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
Libraries Used:
•	pandas – Data manipulation
•	numpy – Numerical computations
•	sqlalchemy – Database connections
•	mysql-connector-python – MySQL integration
•	psycopg2 – PostgreSQL integration
 
5. Explore the Data
•	Load CSV into a Pandas DataFrame:
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/walmart_sales.csv')
df.info()
df.describe()
df.head()
•	Check distribution, column names, types, and potential issues.
 
6. Data Cleaning
•	Remove duplicates
•	Handle missing values
•	Fix data types (dates → datetime, prices → float)
•	Format currency
•	Validate cleaned data
 
7. Feature Engineering
•	Create Total Amount column:
df['Total_Amount'] = df['Unit_Price'] * df['Quantity']
•	This helps in faster aggregation during SQL queries.
 
8. Load Data into SQL Databases
•	Connect to MySQL & PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy
•	Automate table creation and data insertion
•	Verify with initial SQL queries
 
9. SQL Analysis
Key business questions answered:
•	Revenue trends across branches & categories
•	Best-selling product categories
•	Sales performance by time, city, and payment method
•	Peak sales periods
•	Profit margin analysis by branch and category
 
10. Project Publishing
•	Document the workflow in:
o	README.md (this file)
o	Jupyter Notebooks
o	SQL scripts
•	Push to GitHub with:
o	Code files
o	Data (if allowed) or data access instructions
o	Visualizations
 
📊 Key Insights
•	Sales: Highest sales in [Top Category] and [Top Branch]
•	Profitability: [Top Category] yields maximum profit
•	Customer Trends: Peak hours identified for targeted promotions
 
🚀 Future Enhancements
•	Add real-time dashboards in Power BI/Tableau
•	Automate data ingestion & analysis
•	Incorporate external datasets for deeper insights
